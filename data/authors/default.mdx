After graduating from Senior High School in 2022, I decided to pursue my interest in programming. I enrolled in University and studied web development.My favorite part of programming problem-solving aspect. I love the feeling of finally finding a solution to a problem.

I'm currently learning React, Next.js, Node.js, and MongoDB. I am also familiar with TypeScript and Prisma. I am always looking to learn new technologies. I am currently looking for a full-time position as a software developer.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing video games, like Genshin Impact, and Clash of Clans. If I'm not playing video games I watch movies. I also learning new things. I am currently learning about coding and philosophy. I'm also learning how to play the guitar.
